    Abstract
  </h1>
  <p>
     Cannabis is known to have varying effects on the body (cognitive, social, physiological, etc.) dependent on numerous factors (strain, method of consumption, BMI of consumer, etc.). The purpose of the present study was to replicate Cuttler et al.’s research and examine any sex differences in acute cannabis effects with a focus of appetite changes.<br>
    The results indicated no difference in desire to eat (munchies) between men and women. This finding goes against related literature and is likely due to our female biased sample. The effect of loss of appetite was inconclusive due to a limited number of expected responses. 
Conclusions: Although our replication of Cuttler et al.’s research did not find cannabis-related sex differences for appetite changes, related literature has determined otherwise. Cannabis research is a growing need as this drug is becoming more affluent to varying ages of consumers. As cannabis continues to become legalized across states, it’s research can inform all related parties about the risks and benefits of cannabis.
